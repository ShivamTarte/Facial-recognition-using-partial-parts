# Facial-recognition
This was capstone project and one of my research paper where facial recognition was done through parts of faces like nose,mouth and eyes.The main focus of project was to detect face of person even if partial face is visible.If face is damaged in accident,if face was recorded by webcam,if face is masked or any other reason to recognize face this model is used.

3 model were built where face is cropped by eyes,nose,mouth and seperately recognized according to parts.Face landmark detection is used to locate part of face.After that cropping out filtering and modifications are done on this part.Then face reccognition done using these parts.

Haar cascade model is used for onbject detection.Face landmark points locating parts of body then using convolution neural network with droup to do face recognition gives output result 0 or 1 for faces to be similar or not respectively.
